# Syntax Highlighting

### Syntax Highlighting \(em, strong, mark\)

It is not necessary to follow it because Syntax Highlighting can be changed by CSS, but it is recommended to use it to express purpose.

`<strong>` is an expression of emphasis with objective characteristics,

`<em>` is an expression of emphasis with subjective characteristics,

`<mark>` is used for highlighting.



### Example

```markup
<body>
    <h1>em, strong, mark</h1>
    <p>The most beautiful flower in mygarden is <em>rose</em></p>
    <!-- I used em tag because others can think 
    sunflower is the most beautiful flower in my garden -->
    <p><strong>Warning!</strong> This area is dangerous.</p>
    <p><mark>Lorem ipsum dolor</mark> sit amet consectetur adipisicing.</p>
</body>
```
