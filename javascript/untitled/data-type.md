# Data Type

### Value

A value is an expression that can no longer be evaluated. An expression is a statement that generates a value. That is, the expression is evaluated to produce a value.

```javascript
let sum = 1 + 2;
```

`1 + 2` is expression. This expression consists of the values 1 and 2 and the operator\(+\). This expression is evaluated by the JavaScript engine to generate a new value of '3'. The newly created value of '3' can not be evaluated anymore. In other words, when you evaluate '3', it is always '3'. This is value.

The value has a data type and is stored in memory as a binary\(bit sequence\). The data type is the type of value. In other words, there are kinds in the values. The data type of the value '3' generated by evaluating the expression `1 + 2` is a number type. This number type '3' is stored in memory in binary.

A variable is the name of a memory space or the memory space itself in which a value can be stored. Therefore, the value can be assigned to a variable.

The sum that is assigned to sum is not an expression, but an expression that evaluates to a value of 30.

The thing that assign to sum is not an expression, but a '3' that is value created by evaluating the expression.



### Creating a Value

Values can be generated in a variety of ways \(expressions\). The most basic method is to use literal notation.



#### **literal**

A literal is a fixed value itself created directly in the source code. More specifically, literals are interpreted and evaluated by the JavaScript engine. Literal is created as literal notation.



#### **Generating values using literal notation**

```javascript
// Numeric literal 3 is created in literal notation.
// The JavaScript engine interprets the numeric literal 3
// at runtime and generate a numeric value of 3.
3;
```

A literal is a human-readable notation that order the JavaScript engine to generate a value.

A literal in itself an expression and is sometimes used to generate other values as part of an expression.

```javascript
// 1 and 2 are literals
// 1 + 2 is an expression
// 1 and 2 are part of an expression

1 + 2;
```

```javascript
// integer literal
100
// Floating Point literal
10.5
// Binary literal (starts with 0b)
0b01000001
// Octal literal (introduced in ES6, starting with 0o)
0o101
// Hexadecimal literal (introduced in ES6, starting with 0x)
0x41

// strung literals
'Hello'
"World"

// Boolean literals
true
false

// null literal
null

// undefined literal
undefined

// object literal
{ name: 'Lee', gender: 'male' }

// array literal
[ 1, 2, 3 ]

// function literal
function() {}

// regular expression literal
/ab+c/
```

```javascript
// A literal can be a value by itself
let number = 3;

// but the value is not a literal.
let sum = 1 + 2;
```

```javascript
// The literal 3 is evaluated by the JavaScript engine and has a numeric value of 3
let number = 3;

// but the numeric value(evaluated by the JavaScript engine) 3 is not a literal.
let sum = 1 + 2;
```



#### **expression**

An expression is a combination of literals, identifiers \(variable names, function names, etc.\), operators, function calls, and so on. Expressions create a single value by evaluating.

That is, an expression is a statement that can be evaluated as a single value.

The expression evaluates to produce a value, but can not do anything further.

```javascript
// Literal expression
10;

// Identifier expression (assuming the declaration already exists)
sum;
person.name;
arr[1];

// Operator expression
10 + 20;
sum = 10;
sum !== 10;

// Function / method call expression (assuming the declaration already exists)
square();
person.getName();
```



#### **Statement**

A statement is a command to a JavaScript engine that consists of a combination of one or more expressions and keywords.

All code in JavaScript is a statement or expression. An expression can itself be a statement. But the statement can not be an expression.

The role of an expression is to generate a value. The role of the statement is to issue a command to the JavaScript engine using the value generated by the expression.

```javascript
// Variable declaration statement
let x;

// Expression statement (assignment statement)
x = 1;

// Function declaration statement
function a() {}

// Conditional statement
const a = 1;
if (a > 0) {
  console.log(a);
}

// Repetitive Statement
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

```



#### **Expression Statement, Non-expression Statement**

There is a statement that is an expression and a statement that is not an expression. A statement that is an expression is a statement that can be evaluated as a value, and a statement that is not an expression is a statement that can not be evaluated as a value. For example, a variable declaration can not be evaluated as a value. Therefore, it is a non-expression statement. However, an assignment statement is itself an expression.

```javascript
// Variable declaration statement
let x;

// The assignment statement itself is an expression,
// but it is also a complete statement.
// Accordingly , an assignment statement is itself an expression.
x = 1;
```



### Dynamic typed language

A data type is a type of data that is stored in a variable, such as a number or a string.

In programming language such as C or JAVA, there are integer type variables, floating point type variables, etc., so that only data that matches the type of the variable can be stored. This type of language is called a static typed language. However, JavaScript does not have a type in a variable, so you can store all types of data in a variable.

```javascript
let pi;
console.log(typeof pi); // undefined

pi = 3.14;
console.log(typeof pi); // number

pi = "ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter";
console.log(typeof pi); // string

pi = true;
console.log(typeof pi); // boolean

pi = null;
console.log(typeof pi); // object

pi = Symbol();
console.log(typeof pi); // symbol

pi = { pi: "3.14" };
console.log(typeof pi); // object

pi = ["3.14"];
console.log(typeof pi); // object

pi = function() {};
console.log(typeof pi); // function
```



### Classification of data types

All values in JavaScript have a data type.

JavaScript \(ES6\) provides seven data types. Seven data types can be classified into primitive type and object / reference type.

Primitive type data is defined as an immutable value that is the most basic element of data.

The value of JavaScript that does not belong to the primitive type is an object. An object is a complex data type created by combining variables. You can change the value stored in the object. The object is a reference type. Therefore, when you assign the value of an object type to a variable, the variable is assigned a reference to that object \(memory location information\).

* Primitive type:
  * Number type: number \(integer, real number\)
  * String type: string
  * Boolean types: Logical true and false.
  * undefined type: a value that is implicitly assigned to a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value
  * null Type: The value to use when deliberately specifying that there is no value.
  * Symbol type: Newly added 7th type in ES6
* Object / reference type:
  * object, function, array, etc.



#### **Number**

According to the ECMAScript specification, numeric-type values follow a double-precision 64-bit floating-point format: a numeric value between -2^53 -1 and 2^53 -1. That is, JavaScript handle all number in real numbers and there is no specific data type for integer.

However, array indexes and bit operations are calculated in 32-bit integers.

Number literal:

| Classification | Notation | Example | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Integer literal | decimal number | 123 | Express the integer as it is |
|  | hexadecimal | 0x2a | Number with Prefix '0x' |
|  | Octal | 0o73 | Number with Prefix '0o' |
|  | binary | 0b101 | Number with Prefix '0b' |
| Floating Point literal | integer.decimal | 3.14 | Express the decimal as it is |
|  | decimal | 0.123 | If the integer part is 0, 0 can be omitted. |
|  | mantissa \* e \* exponent | 6.02e23 | 6.02 \* 10^23 |
|  | mantissa \* E \* exponent | 1.616199R-35 | 1.616199 \* 10^-35 |

```javascript
// All are numeric types.
const integer = 1; // Integer
const double = 1.2; // real number
const negative = -1; // negative integer
```

Integer, real, binary, octal, and hexadecimal literals are all stored in memory in binary 64-bit floating point format. Because JavaScript does not provide a data type to represent binary, octal, or hexadecimal numbers, any reference to these values is interpreted as a decimal number.

```javascript
let binary = 0b01000001;
let octal = 0o101;
let hex = 0x41;

console.log(binary); // 65
console.log(octal); // 65
console.log(hex); // 65
console.log(binary === octal); // true
console.log(octal === hex); // true
```

```javascript
// All numeric types are considered as real numbers.
console.log(1 === 1.0); // true
console.log(4 / 2); // 2
console.log(3 / 2); // 1.5
```

Singular value:

| Classification | Notation | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| global variable | Infinity | Plus Infinity |
| global variable | NaN | Not a Number |
| Number's property | Number.POSITIVE\_INFINITY | Plus Infinity |
| Number's property | Number.NEGATIVE\_INFINITY | Minus Infinity |
| Number's property | Number.MAX\_VALUE | maximum value that can be expressible |
| Number's property | Number.MIN\_VALUE | minimum value that can be expressible |
| Number's property | Number.NaN | Not a Number |
| Number's property | Number.EPSILON | 2.22044604925031e-16 |
| Number's property | Number.MIN\_SAFE\_INTEGER | -9007199254740990 |
| Number's property | Number.MAX\_SAFE\_INTEGER | 9007199254740990 |

```javascript
console.log(1 / 0); // Infinity
console.log(1 / -0); // -Infinity
console.log(1 * 'String'); // NaN
```



#### **String**

The String type is used to represent text data. A string is a set of zero or more 16bit Unicode characters \(UTF-16\) that can represent most characters in the world.

Strings are generated by inserting text in single quotation marks \(' '\), double quotes \(" "\). The most common notation is to use single quotes. \(I explained why I used double quotes for string type on the introduction page. It will be rectified in a follow-up fix\)

```javascript
'Hello World';
'Hello "World"';
'3.14';
'';
```

| Escape Sequence | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| \0 | null |
| \b | backspace |
| \t | tab |
| \n | new-line character |
| \v | vertical tab character |
| \f | form-feed |
| \r | carriage return |
| \' | single quotation |
| \" | double quotation |
| \ | backslash |



#### **Boolean**

Boolean type values are only true and false indicating logical true or false.



```javascript
const a = 10;

if (a === 10) {
  console.log(true); // true
}

const b = 20;

if (b === 10) {
  console.log(true)
} else {
  console.log(false); // false
}
```



#### **undefined, null**

Singular value for representing no value are undefined and null.

undefined means undefined state and the next value will be undefined:

* Value of a variable that has not yet assigned a value
* The value when attempting to read a property of an object that does not exist.
* The value when attempting to read an element of an array that does not exist
* The value returned by the function that returns nothing.
* The value of the argument that was not passed when the function was called

null is used to intentionally specify that a variable has no value \(intentional absence\).

null is usually used as a value to pass when there is nothing.



#### **Symbol**

The symbol is the value of the primitive type that can not be changed, newly added type in ES6. Symbols are used primarily to create unique property keys for objects with no risk of name collision.

Symbol is created by using Symbol \(\).

```javascript
let sym1 = Symbol();
```

Symbol creates a new value each time it is called.

```javascript
let sym2 = Symbol();
```

Therefore, sym1 and sym2 are different values.

```javascript
console.log(sym1 === sym2); //false
```

You can add a description to symbol by adding an argument to Symbol \(\).

```javascript
const WHITE = Symbol('white');
console.log(WHITE.toString()); // Symbol(white)
```

```javascript
let key = Symbol("key");
console.log(typeof key); // symbol

let obj = {};

// Use the symbol key as the only property key that has no risk of name collision.
obj[key] = "value";
console.log(obj[key]); // value
```

Symbol.for\(\) can be used to create a symbol associated with a string.

```javascript
let sym1 = Symbol.for("hello");
```

Then, Symbol is created on global registry.

```javascript
let sym2 = Symbol.for("hello");
console.log(sym1 === sym2); // true
```

This feature allows you to share the same symbol in any part of your code. The string associated with the symbol can be obtained with Symbol.keyFor\(\).

```javascript
let sym1 = Symbol.for("hello");
let sym2 = Symbol("hello");
console.log(Symbol.keyFor(sym1)); // hello
console.log(Symbol.keyFor(sym2)); // undefined
```

\*\*\*\*

#### **Template literal**

Template literals look similar to regular strings, but use a backtick\(\`\) instead of the usual quote like ' or ".

Even if you do not use an escape sequence in a string literal, it will be output as you originally typed it.

```javascript
let a = `Hello World`;

console.log(a); // Hello World

let b = `Hello
            World`;
console.log(b);
// Hello
//            World
```

String Interpolation

Template literals provide the function to insert strings in a simple way without using the + string operator.

When you place a placeholder\(`${...}`\) inside a template literal, the JavaScript engine evaluates the ... part as an expression.

You can use this to insert the value of a variable or expression into a string.

```javascript
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
console.log(`${a} + ${b}`); // 1 + 2
console.log(`${a} + ${b} = ${a + b}`); // 1 + 2 = 3
console.log(`1 + 2 = ${1 + 2}`); // 1 + 2 = 3

let now = new Date();
console.log(`Today is ${now.getMonth() + 1} ${now.getDate()}`);
```
