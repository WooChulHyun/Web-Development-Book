# Prototype

### Problems with method definition in constructor

If you define a method after 'this' in the constructor, the same method is added to every instance created by that constructor. Therefore, if you create multiple instances with the constructor containing the method, you will create multiple method as many as  you create instances and you will waste the memory.

```javascript
function Circle(radius) {
  this.radius = radius;
  this.area = function () {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  };
}

const circle1 = new Circle(2);
const circle2 = new Circle(5);
```

Every object \(instance\) created by the Circle constructor function has a radius property and a area method. The value of the radius property is typically different instance by instance. \(The radius property may be the same if multiple instances of the same state are needed.\) But the area method is used for all instances and it is exactly same.



## Prototype

In JavaScript, only functions have a prototype property.

```javascript
function F() {}
console.log(F.prototype); // {constructor: Æ’}

const a = {};
console.log(a.prototype); //undefined
```

The object which is pointed from the prototype property of the function is called the prototype object of the function. The prototype property defaults to an empty object.

Properties of a prototype object can be used as properties of that instance in all instances created by the constructor.

```javascript
function F() {}

F.prototype.prop = 'prototype value';

const obj = new F();
console.log(obj.prop); // prototype value

obj.prop = 'instance value';
console.log(obj.prop); // instance value
console.log(F.prototype.prop); // prototype value
```

#### 

#### Example

```javascript
function Circle(radius) {
  this.radius = radius;
}

Circle.prototype.area = function () {
  return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
};

const circle1 = new Circle(2);
const circle2 = new Circle(5);

console.log('radous: ' + circle1.radius, '// area: ' + circle1.area());
// radous: 2 // area: 12.566370614359172
console.log('radous: ' + circle2.radius, '// area: ' + circle2.area());
// radous: 5 // area: 78.53981633974483
```

### Prototype Object

A prototype is an object that acts as the parent object and provides shared properties \(including methods\) to other objects. A descendant \(child\) object that inherits the prototype can freely use the properties of its parent object as its own properties.

All objects have an internal slot called \[\[Prototype\]\]. This is an object different from the prototype property of the function object.

Every object has one prototype. The prototype is null or an object. And all the prototypes are linked with the constructor function. That is, objects, prototypes and constructor functions are linked together.

An object can access its prototype, that is, the object pointed to its \[\[Prototype\]\] internal slot, via the `__proto__` accessor property, as shown above. And prototypes can access constructor functions through constructor properties. The prototype function can access the prototype through the prototype property.



### The object's `__proto__` accessor property

All objects can access their prototype ,that is, \[\[Prototype\]\] internal slots via the `__proto__`accessor property. \(The `__proto__` property of an object points to the parent object that inherited the object.\)

Thus, an object can use the properties of the parent object pointed to by the `__proto__` property.

```javascript
const objA = {
  name: 'Kim',
  sayHello() {
    console.log('Hello! ' + this.name); // Hello Lee <-- result
  }
};

const objB = {
  name: 'Lee'
};

objB.__proto__ = objA;
const objC = {};
objC.__proto__ = objB;
console.log(objC.sayHello());
```

The three objects in the above code are linked by using the `__proto__` property.
